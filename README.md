Last Updated: 8/13/21

***DISCLAIMERS FOLLOW: Please review and be advised of the following:*** 

I am a lawyer admitted to practice in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  

**DISCLAIMER OF ATTORNEY – CLIENT RELATIONSHIP**

Unless we have entered into a written engagement letter providing for paid legal services, **I am not your lawyer** and **do not** represent you or your interests. If we have entered into a written engagement letter, such representation is qualified by any limitations set forth in such engagement letter, including with respect to scope.  

From time to time, I may engage in "autonomous lawyering," adhering to the principles further set forth here. When analyzing or discussing law or situations involving legal issues under the principles of autonomous lawyering that could be construed as work product, it is the result of representing myself or acting non-representationally in the context of belonging to a community of incentive-aligned supporters of a decentralized technology system. As such, no attorney-client relationship exists between myself and these communities and the persons in them are not my clients, should not rely on any work product produced, and will have no expectation of confidentiality (nor do I have any intention to treat their information as confidential) or that any attorney-client privilege exists. Thus, in engaging in autonomous lawyering, and with respect to any work product produced in connection it, I am acting on my own behalf, whether or not such work product is produced by a community of like-minded individuals, but will nevertheless seek to provide accurate and honest information with respect to my work product and my role while observing my general nonrepresentational professional responsibilities such as demonstrating respect for the legal system.  

In engaging in autonomous lawyering, I am not acting on behalf of any law firm, law partners, or any employer, organization, or entity with which I am affiliated, nor on behalf of my clients (i.e., those with whom I am employed as counsel or with whom I have signed engagement letters providing that I will act as their attorney). Any views or opinions expressed in work product or otherwise in furtherance of autonomous lawyering are mine and do not reflect the opinions or views of any firm, law partners, or my employer, entity, or organization with which I am affiliated. If my views expressed in autonomous lawyering contexts are inaccurate, there will be no legal recourse against me and an injured party will not be covered by malpractice insurance.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

For the avoidance of doubt, I assume no responsibility or liability for any errors or omissions in any work product that is a result of autonomous lawyering efforts. Any views expressed, and/or any analysis or other work product provided, are “as is” for public discourse and discussion purposes only, with no guarantees of completeness, accuracy, usefulness or timeliness, and without warranty of any kind, express or implied. 

As such, any work product provided or created as a result of my autonomous lawyering should not be used as a substitute for consultation with professional accounting, tax, legal, or other advisers.  In no event will I or my law firm, or the partners, agents, or employees thereof be liable to you or anyone else for any decision made or action taken in reliance on the information in any autonomous lawyering work product or for any consequential, special or similar damages, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. 

I currently engage in autonomous lawyering in the following communities and have the following economic or other interests therein:  

* [LeXpunK Army](https://judge-jowday.medium.com/rise-of-lexpunk-army-5afad79966f1)
* [LeXpunKDAO1](https://judge-jowday.medium.com/lexpunk-dao1-cryptolaw-for-degens-d1ea19352d13)
* [LexDAO](https://www.lexdao.coop/)

At any given time, I may also hold non-immaterial amounts (by portfolio %) of BTC, ETH, SUSHI, UNI, MATIC, AAVE, LUNA, and various stablecoins. 

*I disclaim any responsibility to keep these disclosures up to date, but currently anticipate updating them from time to time to reflect the changes I deem sufficiently material to warrant voluntary disclosure.*
